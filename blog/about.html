    <h2> About Me Myself</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;margin-right: 20px;">
        Mahendra Singh Dhoni, commonly known as MS Dhoni, is a former Indian cricketer and captain of the Indian national cricket team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest captains in the history of cricket, having led India to many notable victories including the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy.

Dhoni was born on July 7, 1981 in Ranchi, Jharkhand and made his debut for the Indian cricket team in December 2004. He was known for his calm and composed demeanor on the field, earning him the nickname "Captain Cool". Dhoni was also an accomplished wicket-keeper and batsman, known for his big-hitting abilities in the middle order.

In addition to his success in international cricket, Dhoni also led the Chennai Super Kings to three Indian Premier League titles and two Champions League Twenty20 titles. He announced his retirement from international cricket in August 2020, but continued to play for the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.

Off the field, Dhoni has been involved in several philanthropic and business ventures, including co-owning a football team and a Supercross motorbike racing team. He was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian award, in 2009, and the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian award, in 2018.
